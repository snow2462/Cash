## Instructions

The client's Personal Finance Tracker App is in progress and is at a stage where users can currently view the balance of a specific account. The client has expressed the desire to add further functionality to enhance the user experience, and here's a breakdown of their requests:

1. Below the account balance, we would like to see the last ten transactions, including the title and cost (this account will only contain debits, no credits).
2. The account balance and transactions should be saved so that the user can view their balance and transactions even when offline. These values should refresh when a new network connection is available.
3. Implement the new styles that have been provided in a [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/gc7NONoPrghg2sVwItLu6f/Formula-Money?type=design&node-id=1%3A2&mode=design&t=jayHJnsOxRog2r49-1).

**Stretch Goals (Optional):**
- **In-App Purchase for Premium Feature:** Implement in-app billing functionality to manage access to our premium tier. We have an API that can take a collection of transactions and display simple budgeting advice for the user.

These requests come directly from the client alongside the initial codebase. The stretch goals are optional but would be highly valuable if achievable within the time frame.

The client has also provided an [API service](https://8kq890lk50.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prd/api) you can use for retrieving transactional data. It's already used for the Balance.

Please review the existing assets and begin working on these features as per the client's requests.
